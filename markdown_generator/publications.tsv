2015-08-18	no	Persistence of Regional Wage Differences in China	Pacific Economic Review	"Abstract: Regional wage differences in China appear to be persistent and even to have grown over the past two decades. We study potential explanations for this phenomenon. After adjusting for the difference in the cost of living across provinces, we find that some of the cross-province differences in real wages could be related to the quality of labour, industry composition and geographic location of provinces. These factors, taken together, explain approximately half of the cross-province real wage variation. Interestingly, we find that interprovincial government transfers have not offset regional wage differences during the time period we consider. We also demonstrate that interprovincial migration, while driven in part by levels and changes in wage differences across provinces, did not help offset these differences. These results are consistent with findings in the literature that cross-province labour mobility in China is still limited."	"Candelaria, C. A., Daly, M. & Hale, G. (2015).

2017-08-30	no	The Effects of No Child Left Behind on Children's Socioemotional Outcomes	AERA Open	"Abstract: Many people have worried about possible adverse effects of high-stakes testing on socioemotional outcomes. This article uses a difference-in-differences approach to investigate the effects of the introduction of high-stakes testing via the No Child Left Behind Act on socioemotional outcomes. Data are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey-Kindergarten Cohort of 1998-1999, a nationally representative longitudinal survey. The 10 outcomes that we examine are from the children's Self-Descriptive Questionnaire, including externalizing problems related to paying attention and behavior in school, internalizing problems related to feeling sad and lonely and academic anxiety, as well as interest and competence in math, reading, and school in general. We find that the introduction of high-stakes test accountability did not have consistent significant effects on these socioemotional outcomes. These findings can help states address concerns and motivate further research on potential unintended consequences of revised accountability systems under the Every Student Succeeds Act."

A Comprehensive Summary of State-Specific Responses to School Finance Reforms from 1990-2014	Education Finance & Policy	"Abstract: Sixty-seven school finance reforms (SFRs), a combination of court-ordered and legislative reforms, have taken place since 1990; however, there is little empirical evidence on the heterogeneity of SFR effects. In this study, we estimate the effects of SFRs on revenues and expenditures between 1990 and 2014 for twenty-six states. We find that, on average, per pupil spending increased, especially in low-income districts relative to high-income districts. However, underlying these average effect estimates, the distribution of state-level effect sizes ranges from negative to positive—there is substantial heterogeneity. When predicting SFR impacts, we find that multiple state-level SFRs, union strength, and some funding formula components are positively associated with SFR effect sizes in low-income districts. We also show that, on average, states without SFRs adopted funding formula components and increased K–12 state revenues similarly to states with SFRs."	"Shores, K. A., Candelaria, C.
