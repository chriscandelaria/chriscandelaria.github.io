Welcome to my research website!

My research primarily focuses on school finance and resource allocation. One of my research aims is to characterize the contexts in which money matters for student outcomes by examining changes in federal, state, and local school funding systems. A second aim is to better understand the resources that school systems employ to improve student outcomes. For example, I examine teacher labor markets and teacher effectiveness, given that teachers are one of the most important human resources that affect student outcomes. 

To address my research questions, I use economic theory and principles to develop my understanding of the constrained resource decisions that school leaders make to improve student outcomes. I also use econometric and statistical methods, applied to large-scale longitudinal databases and administrative data records, to produce research that will inform policy discussions regarding resource allocation in public schools and the implications that these decisions have for equity.
