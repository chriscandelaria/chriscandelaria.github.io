The goal of this Ph.D.-level course is to develop an understanding of regression analysis. Topics covered include the simple linear regression model, interval estimation and hypothesis tests on regression parameters, prediction, multiple regression, omitted variable bias, multicollinearity, joint tests of significance, regression with indicator variables, and estimation of limited dependent variable models. Students also gain experience using the software program Stata as a means to estimate regressions.
