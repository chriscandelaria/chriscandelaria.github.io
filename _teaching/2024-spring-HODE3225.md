## Course Description

This undergraduate-level course provides a foundation of knowledge for the economics of the public sector. Then the course examines economic models to explain real world government policymaking with a specific focus on education policy.

In this course, we first provide a foundation of knowledge for the economics of education. Then
we will focus on the following six guiding questions:
1. Should public funds be used to subsidize investments in education?
2. To what extent do school leaders optimally allocate public funds?
3. How do public schools receive their funding?
4. Does money matter for educational outcomes?
